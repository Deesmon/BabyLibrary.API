# BabyLibrary.API
A dummy library management (manage books, user, loan ...) to practice pattern and various technology. Mainly .net.

My project for this tiny application. Past the first lines, I don't have an order of priority.

* First, building rapidly a small API with user, role, books and loan management. Then consume it with an Angular web app.

* Code refactoring and make generic emerging pattern.

* Build unit test architecture with integration test and e2e test in mind.

* Build a delivery pipeline with Docker on a linux environment based on GitFlow.

* Test some load testing tool (NBomber ?) for future benchmarking.

* Rework solution architecture for better segregation responsability management and project fork.

* Add some transverse concerne like Logging through weaving.

* Build a fluent library to manage execution flow and domain error handling.

* Fork and migrate to a NoSQL database. (CosmoDB, MongoDB ?)

* Implement a trivial CQRS architecture.

* Split Authentication & Library in two micro service, add a third one, build an event architecture (RabbitMQ ?) on top of CQRS.

* Read only Database + Write only Database.

* ...
